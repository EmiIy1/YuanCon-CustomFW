## Controller Modes
Rather than the conventional concept of "modes", the different input methods can be indepentendly toggled.

There are four different forms of input:
1. Keyboard input (buttons)
2. Mouse input (analogs)
3. Gamepad input (buttons+analogs), joystick position = knob position
4. Gamepad input (buttons+analogs), joystick position = knob direction

It should however be noted that (3) and (4) are mutually exclusive.

To toggle modes during normal operation, hold EX1, EX2, and START, then tap the corresponding BTs to enable or disable each.

The mode toggle can also be accessed by holding START for 5 seconds when plugging in the controller (start must be alreadt held before plugging in the USB). START will blink to indicate the countdown is occuring, after which mode selection is entered. Tap the BTs to enable or disable each mode, then tap START when finished to return to normal operation.

Advanced settings such as keybinds can be changed from within the companion configuration tool.

## Lighting Modes
Lighting is seperated into four individually configurable zones:
1. The wing lights
2. The top lights, referred to as the "start" lights
3. The button lights (including lights for the EX buttons, unpopupated on a stock controller)
4. Laser effects, when turning a knob or pressing a button (the latter only when reactive lights are enabled)

When holding EX-1, the mode for a zone can be cycled by tapping the BT corresponding to that zone.

Solid colour lighting is divided into three zones, the start LEDs, the top half of the wing LEDs, and the lower half, respectively. There is currently no way to configure these zones independently on the controller itself, and as such all three zones are updated in unison. The colours in solid colour modes can be changed by holding EX-1 then rotating the corresponding knob for the left or right side.

Reactive lights are enabled by default, and can be toggled by holding EX-1 and tapping FX-L. Reactive lights will show lighting effects when any of the buttons on the controller are pressed.

Auto-HID is enabled by default, and can be toggled by holding EX-1 and tapping FX-R. In Auto-HID mode, the controller will switch to using HID lighting if it detects a game running using HID lighting, then will return to normal after the game closes.

After a configurable amount of time, all LEDs on the controller will dim, and after another period of time they will completely turn off. These thresholds are set at 5 and 15 minutes respectively, but can be changed or totally removed from within the companion configuration tool.
